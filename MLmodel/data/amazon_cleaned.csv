"Samsung Galaxy Buds Live Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Earbuds with Mic, Upto 21 Hours Playtime, Mystic Black",4790,4,"the earphones have good clear sound quality. it lacks base. battery backup is good. anc is a myth in this earphone. it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique tws.this is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws, only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goes.they are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as i can't use earbuds because they fall out frequently). it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. however, it doesn't mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.the finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch. the size of the buds and the case is very small.now about the sound. if the buds fit in one's ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.the sound signature is very bassy for my taste and i have to eq it to my taste. the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. i listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app. anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. in contrary, anc on somewhat opens up the sound. don't buy this for anc.strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iphone 12mini than my galaxy s22 (spotify and apple music). the buds have app support for both android (galaxy wear) and ios (galaxy buds live) but the android app is more feature packed and works better. the ios app couldn't update the firmware (although there is a menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. however, as soon as i connected with my s22, on pairing, the first thing it did was to update the firmware.i love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4k against an mrp of 16k. the do sound very good but does not suit my taste. persons loving bass may love them. don't get them for anc. battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. it has wireless charging too. if your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,best call quality. noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.descent battery life.music is good. not to that top notch, but good in this segment.overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,i am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,bluetooth range is not that good,the sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. i got these for rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until i faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. it feels like i am using bluetooth v3.0. the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. the mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. i think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. i pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. even at rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. it is better to buy a wired iem, atleast it will sound better than this.,in this price samsung brand is goodeasy to wear and good battery backuphardly support the 2 meter bluetooth connectivity","little above average earbuds,buds i love,unique form factor,best call quality ear buds,good but is it worth it,bluetooth range not that good,excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark","little above average earbuds,buds i love,unique form factor,best call quality ear buds,good but is it worth it,bluetooth range not that good,excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark the earphones have good clear sound quality. it lacks base. battery backup is good. anc is a myth in this earphone. it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,bought this solely due to its form factor -

Boya ByM1 Auxiliary Omnidirectional Lavalier Condenser Microphone with 20ft Audio Cable (Black),798,4,"note :@ its ready to go mic, which doesn't need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones.* has 3.5mm jack connector built in, you can use 1/4' connector if needed.@ it has very long cable which measures upto 20 feet, so note that.@ it has absolutely no noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in stock condition, but with simple editing this mic works just fine ( check the review below for detailed settings )there are literally thousands of review on this product, but none explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with audacity software, or even in general. so i took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. so i went to search for best settings on amazon & other sources but in vain. fortunately i myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.first i am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that i found and then listing those settings,pros :-------1. built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. length of cable is insane (20 feet).* i personally didn't find it useful, as i use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with camera.3. has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesn't need any sound card or external device to work.5. has support for multiple device right from smartphones to dslrs and computers.6. it comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.cons :--------1. biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. its just garbage quality and even normal ears can't bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. my normal smartphone's earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. length of cable is way too much for me and i guess for many users. i think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. it comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there's no way to know whether the battery is dead or what's its charging level. only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. so if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn't has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! i am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence i am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. i think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.best setting using audacity software :===================================these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software, which is free !1. open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. select entire audio clip and open ""effects"" and then "" distortion ""3. start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.now select "" distortion type "" option on the top of box and select "" soft clipping "".* or select "" hard limiter "" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. take the ""clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. adjust the ""make-up gain"" cursor little bit if needed, i keep it on 49.* here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. now just click "" apply "".8. now is noise reduction. for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice, but only has background noises that you don't want.9. open ""effects"" and then "" noise reduction ""10. click on "" get noise profile"".11. now select entire audio clip and again open ""effects"" and then "" noise reduction "".12. finally, click on "" ok "" and that's it !now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output. after these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.verdict :-----------i personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. plus price seems slightly more on this. i wouldn't recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,it's not great or best out there for beginners but good-i use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it

"Sure From Aquaguard Delight NXT RO+UV+UF+Taste Adjuster(MTDS),6L water purifier,8 stages purification,Suitable for borewell,tanker,municipal water(Black) from Eureka Forbes",9199,4,"product and service review-buying price 8999 during prime day sale with 10% discount from hdfc debit card.product review!rating 4/5this is a new model launched during prime day from eureka forbes aquaguard line of products named aquasure delight.the product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of 7.5l on paper but holds only 7 liters of water, equipped with reverse osmosis, ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solids(can be manually adjusted only by service engineer!), the 7 liter tank fills at about 30 mins but the water wastage is very high for every 1litre water purified there is a drainage of 1-1.5 litre from the drain pipe (please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing, shaving or watering plants. the drained water is same as tank water just with higher tds). the water taste varies according to the level of tds you choose very low tds will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which i will not recommend. the default tds after purification is set somewhere between 80-100 (drinking water should have tds below 300)manufacturer reviewrating 2/51)the manufacturer of this product is eureka forbes i am giving a rate of 2/5 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that i received was a defective one. the drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full, i asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so i received a defective product out of the box! i ordered for a replacement on amazon which they processed and i got another one in which the led lights were displaced i don't know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect i would have been disappointed for the second time but i observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. the replaced product's valve is functional and now operating without any hassle!service review0/5don't expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. the reasons are1. the people eureka forbes has employed as technicians are thieves, i am saying this because aquasure delight comes with integrated diverter valve, this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the aquaguard inlet! as i hadn't opened the package when it arrived! (because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like tv's washing machines) taking the precaution i didn't open the box so i was unaware that diverter is included in the package! the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when i opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don't. i still have to confirm this with eureka forbes!2) the pre filter doesn't come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, my technician sold it to me at rs 950 which is available at amazon at rs 750 but then if had ordered it from amazon i have to install it by myself. i don't have a drill etc so i had to pay him rs 950 so loss of rs 400 on the technician. my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs 700 to rs 800platform review!2/5the platform in which i bought is of course amazon i am giving it a rating of 2/5 because i received a defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon (amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem) for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so amazon representative was demanding an installation report, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could i make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video i got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as i found it defective to put it up for replacement but i didn't know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!summary1) product is good for the mentioned price!2)aquasure comes with ""integrated diverter valve"" a stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard, don't let your technician charge you for it.3) the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that.4) technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them.5) make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you a hard time replacing it.6) amazon will

bislery water (reason why i have so many bottles which thankful came handy). the deliver and installation was smooth. after installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since it's the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.so i decided to let it full up and once it was full, i turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. i used the empty 2l bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6l as mentioned by the company.after i emptied the filter to its last drop, i turned on the filter with another set of empty bottles at the waste pipe side. it took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 13.2 l worth of bottles as seen in the image. this is roughly 220% or more than twice the amount of filtered water.now the company claims 60% water saved in comparison to other ro+uv filters and i have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. but i think it's a bit much regardless.fir every ~6l of purified water, it wastes ~13l.my tal water tds is ~470filtered water tds is ~86and the waste water tds is ~640maybe it's because of the tds levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and it's possible that the amount might vary for different tds levels at source.but i recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. 13l almost everyday wasted is 390l per month and this is considering you only filter 6l of water per day.i'll redo this once more to see if there's any difference in values. this is juts to keep the potential buyers informed.,i like speed to fill water n less wastage. i like tds adjuster and easy to install . i donât like internal plastic body though i believe itâs steel.. need confirmation. overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 3-4 weeks,deserve a 5 star on product. however, ran into a problem when it comes to installation. the technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. at last

with worst after sales service from eureka forbes!,water taste and tds level and filter age,good product but not good service after installation,excellent product for its price,good product | eureka forbes took time for installation,water wastage is ~220%.,great product this ro purifier,awesome product product and service review-buying price 8999 during prime day sale with 10% discount from hdfc debit card.product review!rating 4/5this is a new model launched during prime day from eureka forbes aquaguard line of products named aquasure delight.the product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of 7.5l on paper but holds only 7 liters of water, equipped with reverse osmosis, ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solids(can be manually adjusted only by service engineer!), the 7 liter tank fills at about 30 mins but the water wastage is very high for every 1litre water purified there is a drainage of 1-1.5 litre from the drain pipe (please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing, shaving or watering plants. the drained water is same as tank water just with higher tds). the water taste varies according to the level of tds you choose very low tds will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which i will not recommend. the default tds after purification is set somewhere between 80-100 (drinking water should have tds below 300)manufacturer reviewrating 2/51)the manufacturer of this product is eureka forbes i am giving a rate of 2/5 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that i received was a defective one. the drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full, i asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so i received a defective product out of the box! i ordered for a replacement on amazon which they processed and i got another one in which the led lights were displaced i don't know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect i would have been disappointed for the second time but i observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. the replaced product's valve is functional and now operating without any hassle!service review0/5don't expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. the reasons are1. the people eureka forbes has employed as technicians are thieves, i am saying this because aquasure delight comes with integrated diverter valve, this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the aquaguard inlet! as i hadn't opened the package when it arrived! (because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like tv's washing machines) taking the precaution i didn't open the box so i was unaware that diverter is included in the package! the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when i opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don't. i still have to confirm this with eureka forbes!2) the pre filter doesn't come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, my technician sold it to me at rs 950 which is available at amazon at rs 750 but then if had ordered it from amazon i have to install it by myself. i don't have a drill etc so i had to pay him rs 950 so loss of rs 400 on the technician. my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs 700 to rs 800platform review!2/5the platform in which i bought is of course amazon i am giving it a rating of 2/5 because i received a defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon (amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem) for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so amazon representative was demanding an installation report, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could i make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video i got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as i found it defective to put it up for replacement but i didn't know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!summary1) product is good for the mentioned price!2)aquasure comes with ""integrated diverter valve"" a stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard, don't let your technician charge you for it.3) the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that.4) technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them.5) make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you a hard time replacing it.6) amazon will not raise an installation request you have to raise it by yourself by calling eureka forbes customer care!overall verdict- 2.5/5,if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka forbes delight
