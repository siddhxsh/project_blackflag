the sound and video lag with distance while connecting bluetooth with headphones.pairing with headphones difficult (need to wait long)feels volumes low.,,i got this to add-on to a high-end system, which traditionally doesn't have the facility. however it's often requested when guests come over. i was using a phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator led made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. the optical out is connected to a dual ess9028 dac, and the device used for transmission is the ipad air.this lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. this means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that 'feature'. it is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. the quality of the included cables is quite poor, so it's best to use something else.compared to the direct input from usb, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. still, this is being used in a high-end system - i suspect with many lesser speaker/amp/dacs it will be acceptable. at maximum output, the level is about 1-2db lower than a direct usb connection to the dac.it is around the same as my signature acoustics unit, which is 1/3rd the size but uses a battery, and doesn't have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.the bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both bt and another optical source/receiver - though only either can be used at a time.the build quality is average. it is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. the onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume (i use the dac remote). it also has only 16 clicks, so the control will be very coarse. the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.overall, it's quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. the sound quality limitations of bt transmission (compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others) cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so i'd rank it close to the top of what you can get as an add-on for a hifi system. for more 'normal' usage, there are cheaper options available.,excellent product,bluetooth range is very less,bought it to connect my old sony 5.1 blueray home theater with mi 4k box which does not have optical sound port. it has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in",Positive,Positive,Not Mentioned,"the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.overall, it's quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. | for more 'normal' usage, there are cheaper options available.,excellent product,bluetooth range is very less,bought it to connect my old sony 5.1 blueray home theater with mi 4k box which does not have optical sound port.","but the manual in the box helps.sound quality over aux cable too is good. | the quality of the included cables is quite poor, so it's best to use something else.compared to the direct input from usb, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. | at maximum output, the level is about 1-2db lower than a direct usb connection to the dac.it is around the same as my signature acoustics unit, which is 1/3rd the size but uses a battery, and doesn't have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.the bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both bt and another optical source/receiver -

"Samsung Galaxy Buds Live Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Earbuds with Mic, Upto 21 Hours Playtime, Mystic Black",Positive,4,"little above average earbuds,buds i love,unique form factor,best call quality ear buds,good but is it worth it,bluetooth range not that good,excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark the earphones have good clear sound quality. it lacks base. battery backup is good. anc is a myth in this earphone. it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique tws.this is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws, only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goes.they are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as i can't use earbuds because they fall out frequently). it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. however, it doesn't mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.the finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch. the size of the buds and the case is very small.now about the sound. if the buds fit in one's ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.the sound signature is very bassy for my taste and i have to eq it to my taste. the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. i listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app. anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. in contrary, anc on somewhat opens up the sound. don't buy this for anc.strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iphone 12mini than my galaxy s22 (spotify and apple music). the buds have app support for both android (galaxy wear) and ios (galaxy buds live) but the android app is more feature packed and works better. the ios app couldn't update the firmware (although there is a menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. however, as soon as i connected with my s22, on pairing, the first thing it did was to update the firmware.i love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4k against an mrp of 16k. the do sound very good but does not suit my taste. persons loving bass may love them. don't get them for anc. battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. it has wireless charging too. if your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,best call quality. noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.descent battery life.music is good. not to that top notch, but good in this segment.overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,i am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,bluetooth range is not that good,the sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. i got these for rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until i faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. it feels like i am using bluetooth v3.0. the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. the mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. i think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. i pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. even at rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. it is better to buy a wired iem, atleast it will sound better than this.,in this price samsung brand is goodeasy to wear and good battery backuphardly support the 2 meter bluetooth connectivity",Positive,Positive,Positive,"little above average earbuds,buds i love,unique form factor,best call quality ear buds,good but is it worth it,bluetooth range not that good,excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark the earphones have good clear sound quality. | over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,bought this solely due to its form factor -

Boya ByM1 Auxiliary Omnidirectional Lavalier Condenser Microphone with 20ft Audio Cable (Black),Positive,4,"detailed review with best settings for better sound output !!!,worth if you know how to use and what to use it for.,good for non-professional recordings,buy this and start creating content for your youtube.,long cable should be optional.... it's too long else good mic for beginners on yt,working as expected,nice product,good ð note :@ its ready to go mic, which doesn't need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones.* has 3.5mm jack connector built in, you can use 1/4' connector if needed.@ it has very long cable which measures upto 20 feet, so note that.@ it has absolutely no noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in stock condition, but with simple editing this mic works just fine ( check the review below for detailed settings )there are literally thousands of review on this product, but none explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with audacity software, or even in general. so i took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. so i went to search for best settings on amazon & other sources but in vain. fortunately i myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.first i am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that i found and then listing those settings,pros :-------1. built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. length of cable is insane (20 feet).* i personally didn't find it useful, as i use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with camera.3. has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesn't need any sound card or external device to work.5. has support for multiple device right from smartphones to dslrs and computers.6. it comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.cons :--------1. biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. its just garbage quality and even normal ears can't bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. my normal smartphone's earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. length of cable is way too much for me and i guess for many users. i think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. it comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there's no way to know whether the battery is dead or what's its charging level. only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. so if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn't has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! i am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence i am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. i think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.best setting using audacity software :===================================these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software, which is free !1. open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. select entire audio clip and open ""effects"" and then "" distortion ""3. start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.now select "" distortion type "" option on the top of box and select "" soft clipping "".* or select "" hard limiter "" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. take the ""clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. adjust the ""make-up gain"" cursor little bit if needed, i keep it on 49.* here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. now just click "" apply "".8. now is noise reduction. for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice, but only has background noises that you don't want.9. open ""effects"" and then "" noise reduction ""10. click on "" get noise profile"".11. now select entire audio clip and again open ""effects"" and then "" noise reduction "".12. finally, click on "" ok "" and that's it !now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output. after these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.verdict :-----------i personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. plus price seems slightly more on this. i wouldn't recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,it's not great or best out there for beginners but good-i use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in wav format, it's good.-you gotta use software/apps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.-it's pretty long and that's good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.-overall it's decent for beginners. i see high-end phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. there are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.they claim noise cancellation, however, i did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. i could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,wire is to long but good if quality of
